Once upon a time, there was a village and a witch in an ancient tower called Blanka.
Her personality is distinct; she always exaggerates her solution, but she's a good and friendly witch.
Due to her nature, the villagers have long since had a terrible prejudice against her.
However, everything changed when Blanka suddenly reduced the world to black and white because all the vibrant colours hurt her eyes.
The villagers now hated her.
So, they offered you a prize of thousands of gold coins if you went into her tower and killed Blanka.
Blanka's tower is tall, 56 floors tall exactly. Every floor, except the last one, has lots of booby traps because she's paranoid about intruders.
