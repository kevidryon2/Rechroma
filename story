Once upon a time, there was a village and a witch in an ancient tower called Blanka.
Her personality is... distinct. She always exaggerates her solution, even though she's a good and friendly witch.
Due to her nature, the villagers have long since had a terrible prejudice against her.
However, everything changed when Blanka suddenly reduced the world to black and white because all the vibrant colours hurt her eyes.
The villagers now hated her.
So, they offered the player a bounty of thousands upon thousands of gold coins if they went into her tower and killed Blanka.
Blanka's tower is tall, 56 floors tall exactly.
Blanka, paranoid, filled the lower floors of her tower with traps and puzzles to slow down intruders.
You set out on a quest to go into her tower and use her magic weapons to defeat her.
Will you be able to reach the top, defeat her, and live like nobility for the rest of your life?
